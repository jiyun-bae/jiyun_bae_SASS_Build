# SASS_Build / AJAX_Build

SASS: A project to practice building SASS through breaking down the page. <br>
AJAX: A project to know the concept of ajax and the method of using request.

## Installation

SASS (https://sass-lang.com/install)

## Plan / Path for AJAX_Build

AJAX(Asynchronous Javascript and XML) is a front-end technique for interactive web applications. AJAX is used with XML, HTML, CSS, and javascript. <br>
In this project, the contents on the profbox have to be shown by using AJAX. <br>
To do this, we have created JSON file and request AJAX using Fetch(for me) in main.js in the class. At the first time, I tried textContent to show the contents, but it didn't work. After I got an hint, I started to use innerHTML in fetch. So I created innerHTML with the name of contents in json file. Also, I put different ids in html for p, ul. p is for coursename, coursecode and profname, and ul is for classtime. During this time, I put debugger in js and checked the flow of code if it is working properly. 

## Usage

SASS allow me to write dry code that will be faster and easier to maintain, which is more efficient than just using CSS. 

devided up SASS files in modules as 8 parts which are bottom, footer, main, mixin, nav, side, table, top. 
this page has clearly divided side and footer sections so I thought it would be effective to divide it like this.
table and nav are fulled with their specific informations.
top and bottom section is also has divided for clarify.
