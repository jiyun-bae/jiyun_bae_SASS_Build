# SASS_Build

A project to practice building SASS through breaking down the page.

## Installation

SASS (https://sass-lang.com/install)

## Usage

devided up SASS files in modules as 8 parts which are bottom, footer, main, mixin, nav, side, table, top. 
this page has clearly divided side and footer sections so I thought it would be effective to divide it like this.
table and nav are fulled with their specific informations.
top and bottom section is also has divided for clarify.

## Contributing

1. checking the contents of index and custom files. 
2. making modules section in SASS.
3. dividing modules to good-organizing scss files.
4. pusing the branch in my github.
5. merging EVERY branches.
6. COMPLETE! Ta-da
